        </h6>
        <h4 id="sub-title">Summery of Article</h4>
        <p>
            This article is about the leadership principles that Amazon has incorporated and used at their company. The leadership principles are used on a daily basis and followed carefully. Amazon originally had 14 principles and added two more recently. These principles have helped improve the company's overall structure, productivity,
             and organization in the many different teams operating for Amazon. The 16 different principles that leaders follow at Amazon are, customer obsession, inventing and simplifying,
             learning and being curious, insisting on the highest standards, delivering results, striving to be earth's best employer, being humble and thinking ahead, taking ownership, being right a lot, hiring and developing the best, thinking big, having a bias for action, being frugal, earning trust, and diving deep.
            All of these principles help Amazon leaders to be the most effective and get the most done. 
        </p>
        <h4 id="sub-title">How Does the Article Connect with Course Content?</h4>
        <p>
            The article connects to course content in multiple ways. The first way the article relates to the course is displayed in the “deep dive” section of the article. Another way the article relates to
             the course is described in the “strive to be earth's best employer” section. An additional area where the article relates to course content is in the “hire and develop the best” section of the article. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly, the article is related to the course because the "deep dive" section talks about and solidifies a tip we learned in the course. The related tip in the course was under the "time management" section, in the planning unit. 
            The article I chose describes that a part of Amazon's leadership principle is that you
             should try to delegate responsibility and tasks that you have when you can. The time management section in the course has the same type of suggestion, both attempting to get leaders to be more efficient and better time managers. Ultimately, this Amazon leadership principle is related to an idea we learned in the course's 
             time management section because it involves delegating responsibilities and tasks when possible. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Secondly, the article is related to the "core culture" concept in the course because one of Amazon’s leadership principles is to help create a work environment where fellow employees can thrive. This concept is related to the idea in the course that people should be careful and considerate of the core culture at a company. 
            The core culture section explains that you should be aware of how the core culture is at a company before applying and says that you should be a positive contributor to the core culture. This idea in the course relates to Amazon’s principle in the article because they both encourage being aware of how the core culture is at
             the company and also both say to try and be a positive contributor to the core culture of one's company.
        </p>
        <p>
            A third link between the article I chose and our course content involves Maslow's hierarchy of needs, specifically the fourth tier, "esteem". One of Amazon's leadership principles is to act more like a mentor to the subordinates on your team and allow them to 
            take a lot of credit for different achievements. There is a link that exists between Amazon's embracement of this principle and Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. In order to be happy and productive,
             Maslow’s hierarchy of needs says that people need to fulfill the existing tiers and continue progressing. Amazon’s principle relates to and fits into this model of keeping people happy and motivated, by actively fulfilling the four tier in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Mentoring and delegating responsibility to subordinates instills confidence and meaning in them, helping them to continue progressing in Maslow’s hierarchy. The principle 
             is linked to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs because the company's principle allows leaders to fulfill a crucial tier in the hierarchy, which results in employees being happier and more productive.

        <h6>The video I chose:</h6>
        <iframe id="video-chosen" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTQpsoHIAhU"></iframe>
        <p> The youtube channel name is, Lets Learn L2, and the person who owns the channel’s name is Kaushik Chaki.</h6>
        The person who owns the channel studies communications. The majority of his lessons are about soft skills and communication. He explains the knowledge he has attained in short, digestible videos. He has a smaller audience base, however, his content has reached a lot of people. 
        </p>
        <h4 id="sub-title">How does the video relate to the course content?</h4>
        <p>
            This video relates to and covers concepts similar to those covered in the course. The first way that the video is related is demonstrated in the "linguistic" barriers section of the video. The video I chose explains that a communication barrier can be formed due to a linguistic barrier,
             meaning a language barrier. The course also explains the same concept with slightly different wording. Ultimately, the linguistic barrier shown in the video and the "process barrier" idea explained in the course are related, with both saying that language can cause a barrier between individuals. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The second way the video is related to course content is when it explains "attitude" barriers. In this part of the video, the speaker explains what attitude barriers are and how they affect communication. Attitude barriers can be connected to the "process barriers" idea in the course. This is because the course explains that having the fear 
            of being criticised leads to not implementing, which is a process barrier. The video says that social anxiety can be a psychological barrier. Fear of being criticised can cause a person to develop social anxiety. This shows that these two concepts are related but are demonstrated using different languages and are therefore connected. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The third way the video is related to the course is when the video explains what perception barriers are. The auditor explains that perception barriers are formed when people do not talk clearly and simply. He says that they are formed because people interpret the 
            message someone is saying differently. This is closely related to the semantic barrier idea in the course. They are related because they both touch on the point of there being a communication barrier when a message is not interpreted correctly.
        </p>
        <h4 id="sub-title">Would I Recommend this Video to Other Students Taking this Course?</h4>
        <p>
            On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 meaning I would absolutely not recommend this video to other students taking the course and 10 meaning I would absolutely recommend it, I would rate this video a 7. I would rate this video at that number because I think it does a very good job of explaining what a communication barrier is and explaining multiple types of barriers that can occur. The video also has good visuals that make it more entertaining and easier to understand. Additionally, the video is clear and simple, making it easy for people to learn the concepts that they should learn. The reason I did not rate the video a 10 is that 
            I thought it could have gone into more detail and explanation of the different barriers.

        <h4 id="sub-title">What are my Strengths and Weaknesess?</h4>
        <p>
            The strengths I have are that I am ambitious, I am decisive, I am a hard worker, and I am disciplined. I set high goals and expectations in my life, and I continuously meet them because I can make decisions fast, have
             enough discipline to follow through on things, 
            and have a strong desire to succeed. The weaknesses I currently have are that my communication skills are not as good as I want them to be and that I procrastinate on tasks that are uninteresting to me.
        </p>

        <h4 id="sub-title">How can I Improve on my Weaknesses?</h4>
        <p>
            I can improve my communication skills by choosing to go out more to meet new people and practise small talk. In order to do this, I need to make it a priority in my life and dedicate more time to it. I should make more plans with my 
            friends and be totally present when I am with them. To stop procrastinating
             on tasks that I do not like doing, I need to change my mindset about the whole situation. I need to convince myself that the task has to get done so that I can work on the other things in my life. Additionally, I need to set early deadlines on things so that there is a sense of urgency to complete the tasks. 
        </p>
        <h4 id="sub-title">What are Some Jobs I Can See Myself Doing in the Future?</h4>
        <p>
            The first job I can see myself doing in the future is working as a software engineer or software developer at a technology company. I could also see myself working in cyber security or as a programmer for a robotics company. I really enjoy working with code and hardware, which is why I want to get into the
             technology industry. After a few years of saving up capital and working for someone else, I want to start my own software or hardware company. I have started small businesses online throughout the years, and I have learned a lot and had a lot of fun through the process. I intend to continue learning and creating
              in the future, eventually running a successful business.

        <h2 id="section-header">Section 4: Leadership Quotes</h2>
        <div id="quote">
            <h5>"Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality". - Warren G. Bennis. </h5>
        </div>
        <p>
            This quote resonates with me because, to me, a leader is someone who generates results and treats people with respect. It resonates with me because I have a lot of things that I want to accomplish and turn into reality, and I will need to be a leader to accomplish that. 
            This quote relates to the leadership styles and theories we learned in the course. Something that all the styles and theories have in common is that they are implemented to produce results. The theories and styles are put in place to translate someone's vision into reality, just like this quote explains. 
        </p>
        <div id="quote">
            <h5>"To handle yourself, use your head; to handle others, use your heart." -  Eleanor Roosevelt
            </h5>
        </div>
        <p>
            This quote resonates with me because I think that it is important that you treat others with up-right respect, and in turn, they will respect you and listen to your ideas and opinions. I think you should look at yourself with a logical view and be hard on yourself; however, you should still respect others, and in return, they will respect you. I believe this is a good motive to follow, as it will help you become a better person and leader. 
            This quote relates to the ethics section of the course. I think that it is ethical to have a logical view of yourself, and I think it is ethical to have respect and understanding when it comes to other people's situations. Additionally, this quote relates to the course in the way that it says you should care about subordinates and should operate a team so that the team has autonomy. 
        </p>
        <div id="quote">
            <h5>"The greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things. He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things." - Ronald Reagan
            </h5>
        </div>
        <p>
            This quote resonates with me because I think that in order to be successful, you need to be able to collaborate with people very well and know when and how to delegate responsibilities.
             Additionally, with those people around you, you need to be able to motivate them to do great things so that the overall goal of the organization can be achieved. This
              quote relates to the "motivating employees" section of the course. I believe that it relates to this section of the course because the quote is basically saying that the leader, or manager, needs to be able to get the people around them to do great things. 
              In order to get employees around you to do great things, they need to be motivated. Ultimately, it is related to the course because the main idea of the quote is that you need to get the people around you to do great things, and to do that, you need to motivate them.
